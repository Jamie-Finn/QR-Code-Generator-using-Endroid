QR-Code-Generator-using-Endroid
===============================

QR Code Generator using the endroid/QrCode library.

The endroid package is included so you should be able to just download the zip and use this code. If it doesn't you can visit the [endroid/QrCode](http://github.com/endroid/QrCode) GitHub page to read the documentation which should hopefully guide you.

To enter your own URL link or if you just want to send simple text, just edit the code shown below in the index.html file.

```
<img src="qrcode.php?text=YOUR URL OR TEXT GOES HERE&size=200&padding=10" alt="QR Code">
```
